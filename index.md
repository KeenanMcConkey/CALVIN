## Welcome to CALVIN's Website

Calvin was created by Keenan McConkey, Austin Khorram, and Glyn Finck for the University of British Columbia's Engineering Physic program's annual robot competition. This years competition involved line following, reading IR beacons, picking up toys ("agents" as we called them), and putting these toys into a box to be sent down a zipline. CALVIN has a bunch of features use to complete this difficult challenge.

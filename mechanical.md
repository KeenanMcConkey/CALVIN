CALVIN's Mechanical Features
=====
Calvin was designed with mechanical simplicity in mind. In order to minimize man-made error in fabrication and assembly of components we created a minimalistic design using a single crane/arm combination with diverse functionality. 

### Materials
The majority of CALVIN's components were fabricated out of hardboard material of varying thicknesses.

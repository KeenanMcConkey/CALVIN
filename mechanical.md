CALVIN's Mechanical Features
=====
Calvin was designed with mechanical simplicity in mind. In order to minimize man-made error in fabrication and assembly of components we created a minimalistic design using a single crane/arm combination with diverse functionality. 

### Materials
The majority of CALVIN's components were fabricated out of hardboard material of varying thicknesses.

### CALVIN's Major Mechanical Components:
#### **Main Chassis**
The main chassis is fabricated out of 3mm thick hardboard fabricated from a laser cutter and assembled with meccano pieces and hot glue. The chassis has many holes cut into it to allow wires and ziplines to weave through it.

#### **Arm**
CALVIN's arm is connected a rotating crane which extends from the rear of the chassis, and has the claw mounted by the four front holes. The arm is fabricated from 6mm thick hardboard and is gear actuated by the smaller gear attached to a servo motor (not shown).

#### **Claw and Claw Mount**
All claw and mount components are fabricated from 3mm thick hardboard, and the four mount pieces are held together by four metal rods connecting them to arm, as well as several elastic bands wrapped around them. Elastic bands were preferred over a more permanent solution such as hot glue or epoxy to allow for ease of servo motor or claw replacement, without sacrificing any mechanical stability. One claw is attached to a small servo motor (not shown), and actuates the other claw with an even 1:1 gear ratio.
